# Cover Page

## Elements

The Cover Page includes:

* A pattern on the left side
  * The pattern is hidden on small screens
* An icon indicating the content type
  * Each Cover Page displays the icon above the title; the icon is specific to the content type (see the Icons section)
* Title
* Description
* Button to access the content
  * The same icon shown above the title should also appear on the button
* Optional image
  * If no image is selected, nothing is displayed in its place (i.e., no placeholder image). In that case, the remaining elements—icon, title, description, and button—should expand to take over the available space (as shown in the screenshots below).
